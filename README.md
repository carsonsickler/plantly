# plantly
Plantly merges Vue frontend, Express server, and ESP32 sensors in a smart plant pot. Sensors monitor light, humidity, temperature, and soil moisture. If soil is dry, ESP32 waters plant via pump. Data is sent to a database via Express server, accessible through Vue frontend with Chart.js for visualization and manual watering.
